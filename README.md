# Deno Manual to PDF

This is my attempt to make Deno Manual available on my Kindle because my eyes are sore.

It has 20pt font and wraps code block so that they fit on the page.

You can either grap PDF from this repository or compile yourself the latest version.

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/asmarcz/deno-manual-export
cd deno-manual-export
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/denoland/deno
python3 gen.py
```
